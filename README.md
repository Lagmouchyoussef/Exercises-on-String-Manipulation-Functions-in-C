# Exercises-on-String-Manipulation-Functions-in-C
A set of exercises focusing on implementing and using various string manipulation functions in the C programming language

***Exercise 1:***
Define a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns its length.

Define a function At, which takes a string TEXT and an index i (integer) as arguments. The function returns the i-th character in the variable text. If the index is less than 0 or greater than the length of the string, the function returns the end marker \0.

Define a function that takes two strings CH1 and CH2 as parameters. The function should concatenate the two strings and store the result in CH1. The concatenation cannot be performed if the length of the concatenated string exceeds the length of CH1. In this case, a message will be displayed to the user.

Define a function that takes a string CH as a parameter. The function returns the number of digits that exist in the string CH. Use the isDigit(character) function from the ctype.h library to check if a character is a digit.

Define a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns the index of the first space in the string.

Define a function that takes a string CH as a parameter. The function should display the string to the console in such a way that it prints one word per line. It is assumed that words are separated by a space.

In the main function, create a menu allowing the user to choose which of the previous functions to execute.
